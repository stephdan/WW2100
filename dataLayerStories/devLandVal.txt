The map of land value shows spatial differences in agricultural and developed 
lands. Farmland value is influenced by agricultural productivity, which is 
determined by characteristics such as soil quality and precipitation or 
irrigation water rights. Developed land value is affected by population density 
and income and varies generally within each urban area.
