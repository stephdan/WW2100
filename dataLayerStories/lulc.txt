<p class="storyTitle">Land Cover</p>

<p>Use the interactive map to view changes in land cover over time for 
different modeling scenarios. Look for these major trends:</p>
  
  <label>Expansion of Cities</label>
  
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		Population growth leads to densification and expansion of cities and 
  		conversion of lands from agricultural (yellow shading) and forest 
  		(green shading) land uses to developed land uses (purple). Use the time 
  		slider bar, to compare the size of cities in 2010, 2050, and 2099.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		The changes in urban spatial extent depends on rates of population and 
  		income growth, land management policies, and land values. Use the 
  		scenario buttons to explore the effect of different assumptions about 
  		population growth.
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <label>Changes in Upland Forests:</label>
  
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		A warming climate leads to drier forests that are more susceptible to 
  		wildfire. Fire opens up lands to  forest types that better suited to 
  		warmer and drier climate conditions. Use the time slider bar to compare 
  		the types of forests that extend over the Willamette Basin uplands. At 
  		high elevations, subalpine forests are replaced by cool conifer 
  		forests. At mid-elevations, Douglas-fir and western hemlock forest 
  		types shift to mixed-conifer forest types.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Forest changes are most extensive in simulations with greater climate 
  		warming. Use the scenario buttons to compare changes in forest types 
  		between low, moderate (Reference Scenario) and high change climate 
  		scenarios.
  	</li>
  </ul>
