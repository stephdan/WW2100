<p>Use the interactive map to view changes in land cover over time 
  	for different modeling scenarios. Look for these major trends:</p>
  
  <label>Expansion of Cities</label>
  
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		Population growth leads to expansion of cities and 
  		conversion of lands from agricultural (yellow shading) and 
  		forest (green shading) land uses to developed land uses 
  		(purple).   Use the time slider bar, to compare the size of 
  		cities in 2010, 2050, and 2099.   
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		The extent of urbanization depends on the rate of 
  		population and income growth, and land management policies.  
  		Use the scenario buttons to explore the effect of different 
  		assumptions about population growth. The Reference scenario 
  		adopts population growth rates from the Oregon Office of 
  		Economic Analysis (2011). Population more than doubles over 
  		the century, rising from 2.41 million in 2010 to 5.37 million 
  		in 2099. The Worst Case scenario assumes than many more 
  		people move Willamette valley cities -- population nearly 
  		quadruples to 8.25 million by 2099.
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <label>Changes in Forest Types:</label>
  
  <ul>
  	<li>
  		A warming climate leads to drier forests that are more 
  		susceptible to wildfire.  Fire opens up lands to regrow into 
  		new forest types better suited to warmer climate conditions. 
  		Use the time slider bar to compare the types of forests that 
  		extend over the Willamette Basin uplands over the 
  		simulations. At high elevations, subalpine forests are 
  		replaced by cool conifer forests. At mid-elevations, 
  		Douglas-fir and western hemlock forest types shift to 
  		mixed-conifer forest types.
  	</li>
  	<li>
  		Forest changes are most extensive in simulations with 
  		greater climate warming.  Use the scenario buttons to 
  		compare changes in forest types between low (Low Climate 
  		Scenario), moderate (Reference Scenario) and high climate 
  		(High Climate Scenario) change scenarios.   Climate warming 
  		and wildfire is most extensive in the high climate scenario 
  		and leads to the most dramatic shifts in forest composition.
  	</li>
  </ul>
