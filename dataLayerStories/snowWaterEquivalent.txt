Changes in snowpack are highly sensitive to temperature. In the most plausible 
scenarios, snowpack declines between 87 and 94 percent by 2099, and becomes 
limited to the highest elevations.

Our results examine the maximum SWE over the January 1â€“ April 1 period for each 
year for the LowClim, Ref, HighClim, and FireSuppress scenarios. The LowClim 
scenario, in which temperatures increase only slightly and winter precipitation 
also slightly increases, shows an increase in seasonal max snow water equivalent 
of about 41% for elevations above 1200 meters (3937 feet). Low elevation snow 
(500- 1200 meters, or 1640-3937 feet) stays roughly the same throughout the nine 
decades, with wide variance and no significant statistical differences for SWE 
between the decades. The Ref scenario shows a steep decline in seasonal max SWE 
at both high and low elevations (-74% and -93%, respectively). SWE declines even 
more steeply in the HighClim scenario with a loss of 90% of SWE above 1200 meters 
(3937 feet) and a loss of 94% of SWE at the 500-1200 meter (1640-3937 feet) 
elevation zone. Hydrologic impacts indicate that the snowmelt contribution to 
spring discharge is lost as snowfall converts to rainfall in winter. Remaining 
snowpack melts earlier. In all but the LowClim scenario, we see an increase in 
winter flows as a result of these declines in SWE.
