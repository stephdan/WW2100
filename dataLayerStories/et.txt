<p class="storyTitle">Evapotranspiration</p>

<p>
One of the ways that climate warming and land use change will affect the water 
cycle in the Willamette Basin, is by changing evapotranspiration, the amount of 
water vapor released from soils and plants into the atmosphere.  
</p>

<p>
Changes in land use and climate conditions affect both land cover and ET - for 
example a young forest with limited foliage will have lower ET than a mature 
forest with dense foliage.  Use the interactive map to look for the following 
trends:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
  	Climate warming leads to a decline in ET from forested uplands.  Warmer 
  	temperatures make forests more susceptible to forest fires, and the fires 
  	reduce the extent of mature forests.  Recently burned and young forests 
  	have a lower ET.  Changes in ET are most dramatic in the High Change 
  	Climate scenario.  Lower ET from uplands forests could slightly increase 
  	water supply to the Willamette Valley.
  </li>
  <li>
  	Expansion of cities leads to a decline in ET in some parts of the 
  	Willamette Valley.  ET in urban areas is usually lower than on agricultural 
  	fields, because so much land area is covered by pavement and buildings.  In 
  	some sub-basin the decline in ET could lead to higher streamflows.
  </li>
</ul>
