Agricultural land value is influenced by agricultural productivity, 
which is determined by characteristics such as soil quality and irrigation 
water rights. Developed land value is affected by factors such as population 
density and distance to the city center. Agricultural lands with irrigation 
water rights tend to have higher land values.
