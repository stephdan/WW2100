<p class="storyTitle">Land Value</p>

The map of land value shows spatial differences between agricultural and 
developed land values. Agricultural land value is influenced by agricultural 
productivity, which is determined by characteristics such as soil quality and 
irrigation water rights. Developed land value is affected by factors such as 
population density and distance to the city center.  Use the time slider and 
scenario buttons to compare how land values change over time and with different 
scenario assumptions.  Land values in urban areas increase with population and 
income growth.  Even though developed land values far exceed agricultural land 
values, other factors, such as Urban Growth Boundaries, restrict the expansion 
of cities.
