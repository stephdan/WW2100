<p class="storyTitle">Max Snow Water Equivalent</p>


<p>
Snowpack changes are highly sensitive to winter temperature. Warmer winters in 
the Reference Case and High Climate Change scenarios lead to an 74-94 percent 
reduction in snowpack by 2099.  Snowpack becomes limited to elevations above 
1200 m.  Use the time slide bar to compare snowpack extent and depth in 2010, 
2050, and 2099 for these two scenarios.

Interestingly, the Low Change Climate scenario shows a slight increase in total 
snow. This is because a warmer atmosphere can deliver more precipitation and 
the slight warming is not great enough to shift winter precipitation from snow 
to rain.
