<p class="storyTitle">Max Snow Water Equivalent</p>

<p>
This map shows the maximum snow water equivalent (SWE), a measure of snowpack, 
averaged by decade. Snowpack is highly sensitive to winter temperature. 
Warmer winters in the Reference Case and High Climate Change scenarios lead to 
an 74-94 percent reduction in snowpack during the 2090s. Snowpack becomes 
limited to elevations above 1200 m. Use the time slide bar to compare snowpack 
extent and depth in the 2010s, 2050s, and 2090s for these two scenarios.

<p>
Interestingly, the Low Climate Change scenario shows a slight increase in 
max SWE. This is because a warmer atmosphere can deliver more precipitation and 
the slight warming is not great enough to shift winter precipitation from snow 
to rain.
